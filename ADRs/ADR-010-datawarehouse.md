## ADR 010: Adoption of PostgreSQL for Analytics and reporting

### Status: Proposed

## Context
Our organization is building an analytics system to collect, store, and analyze user data from our applications. This data includes user interactions, events, and other relevant information. To effectively manage and analyze this data, we need to select a suitable database management system.

## Decision
After careful evaluation, we have decided to use PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing analytics records. This decision is based on the following considerations:

**Mature and Reliable**: PostgreSQL is a mature, open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and stability. It has a proven track record in handling large datasets.

**Scalability**: PostgreSQL offers options for horizontal and vertical scaling, enabling us to handle increasing data volumes and high query loads as our analytics system grows.

**Extensible**: PostgreSQL's extensibility allows us to add custom functions and extensions to meet specific analytical requirements. This flexibility is essential for tailoring the system to our needs.

**Community and Ecosystem**: PostgreSQL has a vibrant and active community, which ensures ongoing support, security updates, and access to a wide range of extensions and tools.

**Performance**: PostgreSQL is known for its excellent performance, especially when properly optimized. We can leverage indexing, partitioning, and other performance-enhancing features to ensure responsive analytics queries.

**Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL enforces data integrity constraints, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analytics data.

## Consequences
By adopting Amazon Redshift as our data warehousing solution, we accept the following consequences:

We will incur costs associated with Redshift usage, including data storage and query costs.
Team members will need to become familiar with Redshift's SQL dialect and its specific features for optimization.
## Alternatives
## Alternative 1: Snowflake
**Pros**: Full control over hardware and infrastructure, potentially lower data storage costs.  
**Cons**: Higher upfront hardware and maintenance costs, limited scalability, longer setup time.

## Alternative 2: Google BigQuery
**Pros**: Serverless, scalable, and fully managed data warehouse solution.  
**Cons**: May involve data migration challenges if not already using Google Cloud, query costs can vary depending on usage.

## Alternative 2: Red shift
**Pros**: Serverless, scalable, and fully managed data warehouse solution.  
**Cons**: May involve data migration challenges if not already using Google Cloud, query costs can vary depending on usage.

## Decision Rationale
Amazon Redshift was chosen because it aligns with our project requirements for scalability, performance, and integration with our existing AWS infrastructure. Its ability to handle large volumes of data and advanced analytics capabilities make it a strong choice for our data warehousing needs. While alternatives were considered, Redshift's combination of features and seamless integration with AWS makes it well-suited for our organization's data analytics and reporting needs.
